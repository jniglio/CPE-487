This is the ghdl code I used in the terminal and output of what I got in GTKwave. 
There was some issue with using the gtkwave command so I had to open the vcd file through the application
My source for the half adder code is this website right here -- https://vhdlguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vhdl/testbench.html
